    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g wheat flour</li>
        <li>At least 10g ground flaxseeds or chia seeds</li>
        <li>250ml oat milk (I usually start with this amount and adjust the consistency as needed)</li>
        <li>About 20g sugar (just enough to make it slightly sweet)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all the ingredients together.</li>
        <li>The batter should be slightly thick so that it spreads well in the pan but still holds together.</li>
        <li>Ideally, let the batter sit for a few minutes so the flax or chia seeds can expand and help bind the mixture.</li>
        <li>TI usually add a little oil to the pan after every second pancake.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>And that's it, enjoy your meal!</p>
